# IML_Artificial_Neural_Networks

## Description:

This project contains the Introduction to Machine Learning Coursework 2 Neural Networks implementation by Daphne Demekas, Nasma Dasser, Constantin Eulenstein and Kevin Landert. The project is split into two parts. In the first part, we created a neural network mini-library using only ```NumPy```. In the second part we designed an algorithm using Neural Networks and ```PyTorch``` to predict the median house price in California. The report for the project is available under the _Intro_ML_Coursework2_report.pdf_ file.


## Project structure:
* **PART1**: 
    * **_part1_nn_library.py_**: contains the implementation of a modular multi-layer neural network library 
* **PART2**:
    * ** _part2_house_value_regression.py_**: contains the implementation of a neural network architecture to predict the median house price in California

## Requirements
IML_Artificial_Neural_Networks requires the following to run: 
* ```Python3```
* ```numpy ```
* ```matplotlib```
* ```PyTorch```
* ```scikit-learn```

## Run instructions:

* This project can be run via the command line using the command ```python3 main.py``` . 
    * The code then runs on the two given inputs _clean_data.txt_ and _noisy_data.txt_. 
* To print individual trees and run the code with different data on **jupyter**
    1. Open the _DecisionTree_Notebook.ipnyb_ in the **jupyter** folder
    2. Run the code
* You can also run the code with another dataset by
    1. Uploading new dataset in the **data/wifi_db** folder
    2. Changing the path to the new dataset in ```main.py```
